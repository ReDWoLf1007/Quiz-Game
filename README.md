# Quiz-Game
This Repository contains the prototype version of my mini project game, which was named Games of Mind.
It contains a number of quiz, solving which will lead to options to play different games.
It was made to introduce Education and Entertainment together in a game.
It is made using only C++, and it's terminal. We have not used any external header files or graphics as for mow.
It looks stupid but it was something for me.
